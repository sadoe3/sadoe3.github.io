## Static classes
```c#
ClassName.MethodName();     // static class usage example
```
- In C#, a static class is a class that consists only of static members, such as static properties and static methods.
- A key characteristic of a static class is that it cannot be instantiated.
- Therefore, to use a static class, you should access it by using the class name directly, as if using the class itself like an object.
