# Event Handling
This post covers things related to **event handling** of `Qt Wdiget` Applications


## Core Architecture
There 3 **classes** you can choose to develop a certain type of Qt Widget applications

### QCoreApplication
`QCoreApplication` is the base class for **non-GUI** applications
- it handles the **basic functionality** needed for `any Qt application` that does **not involve** a graphical user interface (**GUI**)
    * this class manages the event loop and application settings, but it does not provide any GUI functionality
- Use Case
    * if you’re writing a **command-line** application or a non-GUI-based application
        + e.g., a server, a daemon, or a background process
    * you would use `QCoreApplication`

### QGuiApplication
`QGuiApplication` is a **subclass** of `QCoreApplication`
- it adds **GUI-specific functionality** for applications
    * that do **not** use the **full Qt Widgets** system but still require some basic GUI features, such as handling windowing systems, events, and interactions
- Use Case
    * if you are building an application that involves **low-level GUI elements**
        + such as handling `OpenGL` windows, QML-based UIs, or custom widgets without relying on the full Qt Widgets system
    * `QGuiApplication` is appropriate

### QApplication
`QApplication` is the **most commonly used class** in Qt applications when you need both event handling and GUI elements from the Qt Widgets module
- it provides all the necessary event handling and GUI features for creating and managing widgets
- Use Case
    * if you're building a traditional desktop application with a standard set of **Qt Widgets**
        + like buttons, text fields, labels
    * you should use `QApplication`
