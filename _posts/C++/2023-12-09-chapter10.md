# Generic Algorithms

> 이 포스트는 C++ Primer(5th Edition)를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.

## Overview

### Generic Algorithms
The standard library defines a set of **generic algorithms**.
- **algorithms** becuase they implement common classical algorithms such as sorting and searching
- **generic** because they operate on elements of **various** types - not only library types as `std::vector` or `std::list`, but also the built-in array type, and other kinds of sequences as well
    * **iterators** make the algorithms container-independent

### How find() works
Most of the algorithms are defined in the `<algorithm>` header, also a set of generic numeric algorithms are defined in the `<numeric>` header
- in general, most algorithms operate by traversing a range of elements bounded by two **iterators**
```c++
#include <algorithm>
...     // some codes which defines vec a vector object and ia an array
int val = 42;
// vector
auto result = std::find(vec.cbegin(), vec.cend(), val);
std::cout << "the value " << val << (result==vec.cend()) ? " is not present" : " is present" << std::endl;

// array
int * result = std::find(std::begin(ia), std::end(ia), val);    // find whole elements
// or
auto result = std::find(ia + 1, ia + 4, val);   // find val from from ia[1] to ia[3]
std::cout << "the value " << val << (result==std::end(ia)) ? " is not present" : " is present" << std::endl;
```
- the above codes show the typical way to use `find()` method
    * if there is no match, `find()` returned its second iterator 

### How the Algorithms Work
- the algorithms take **two iterators** to get the range to traverse the given collection
- they use the operations, such as `==` or `<`, on the **element type** of the collection to perform their job
    * most of them provide a way for us to supply our **own operation** to use in place of the default operator 


## A first Look at the Algorithms
The library provides **more than 100** algorithms.
- fortunately, they have a **consistent** archiecture
- understanding this architecture makes learning and useing the algorithms easer than memorizing all 100+ of them
    - [this website](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm) or Appendix A(p.866) describes the list of them

### Read-Only Algorithms
