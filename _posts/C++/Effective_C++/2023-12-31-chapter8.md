# Customizing new and delete

> 이 포스트는 Effective C++(3rd Edition)를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.

## Item 49

### Understand the behavior of the new-handler
If operator `new` failed to allocate memory, 
- temp


## Item 51

### Adhere to convention when writing new and delete
The code below is the pseudocode for a non-member operator `new`
```c++

```
- if the allocation failed
    * then, it checks whether the pointer to new-handler is `nullptr` or not
    * if it's not `nullptr`, then it calls that new-handler
        + oterwise, it throws `std::bad_alloc` excaption
- note that the process above is inside **infinite loop**
    * the way out of loop is ~
