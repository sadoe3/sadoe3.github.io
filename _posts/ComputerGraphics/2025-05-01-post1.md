# Colors
- This report explains the fundamental concepts of how digital colors are handled in computer graphics, focusing on the sRGB color space and gamma correction.

## sRGB
### Color Channel
- When a single color channel (e.g., Red, Green, or Blue) has 8 bits, it can represent 256 distinct levels of intensity for that particular color component.
- This allows for a total of $256^3$ or over 16.7 million unique colors when combined in an RGB system.

### Linear and Gamma Space
- **Linear space** is the "physical" realm.
    - It's how light truly behaves and is measured in the real world.
    - In this space, if one light source has twice the energy of another, its numerical value is exactly double.
    - This is the space where all physically-based rendering calculations, such as those in ray tracing, should be performed to ensure accuracy.
- **Gamma space**, on the other hand, is the "perceptual" realm.
    - It's a non-linear color space that's designed to mimic how our eyes perceive light.
    - Since our eyes are more sensitive to changes in dark tones than in bright ones, gamma space allocates more of its data to the darker end of the spectrum.
        - This is why a digital file using gamma space (like a standard 8-bit image) can look so good.
        - it's efficiently using the limited data to represent the colors that matter most to our vision. 
- To summarize:
    - **Linear space** is for accurate calculations.
    - **Gamma space** is for efficient display and storage.

### What is sRGB?
- **sRGB** (standard Red Green Blue) is the most common color space standard for digital content like photos, web graphics, and computer monitors.
    - It's essentially a specific type of **gamma space** that's been widely adopted.
- The sRGB format aids in texture compression by encoding color information in a non-linear way that more closely matches human perception. 
    - This is because our visual system is more sensitive to changes in darker tones. 
- By allocating more bits to represent these darker shades,
    - sRGB ensures that the limited 8-bit color space is utilized more efficiently from a perceptual standpoint, reducing visible banding and improving compression quality.

### Is RGB(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) mid-gray??
- In a **linear** color space, RGB(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) mathematically represents a mid-gray. 
- However, in a **gamma-encoded** color space, this value appears much brighter than a true perceptual mid-gray. 
    - The true mid-gray in a gamma space is significantly darker because of the non-linear curve.

### 18% gray
- 18% gray is a specific shade of neutral gray that reflects 18% of the light that falls on it. 
    - It is a key reference point in photography and cinematography for exposure metering. 
- A common misconception is that 18% gray corresponds to a digital value of 0.18 (out of 1.0) in an sRGB space.
    - However, due to the non-linear sRGB transfer function, an 18% linear gray value corresponds to a digital value of approximately 0.457 ($0.18^{1/2.2}$), which is what appears as a perceptually mid-gray on a monitor. 


## Gamma Correction
### Transfer Function (Gamma Correction)
- A transfer function, specifically gamma encoding, is applied to linear light values to bridge the gap between linear space and gamma space.
    - This non-linear operation extends the dark tones and compresses the bright tones to make them more perceptually uniform for our eyes.
- The reverse process, gamma decoding, is crucial for rendering calculations.
    - This is because all physical light interactions (e.g., combining colors, shadows) must occur in **linear space** to be physically accurate.
- Failure to properly manage this transfer function can lead to an image that is significantly darker or has an incorrect tonal balance.

### How to apply gamma correction?
- A common simplification uses a gamma value of 2 to illustrate the conversion between linear and gamma spaces.
    * To convert a gamma-encoded value $g$ to a linear value $l$:
        * $l = g^\gamma$
        * For a gamma of 2, this becomes:
            * $l = g^2$.
    * To convert a linear value $l$ back to a gamma-encoded value $g$:
        * $g = l^{1/\gamma}$
        * For a gamma of 2, this becomes:
            * $g = \sqrt{l}$.

### Should normal and roughness textures be gamma-corrected?
- No, normal and roughness textures should not be gamma-corrected.
- These textures store data that represents physical properties of a surface (e.g., direction of a normal, surface roughness), not color.
    - This data must remain linear for physically based rendering calculations to be correct.

### Color Transformation in Real-Time Rendering
- The process of simulating light and color in a game engine involves a series of transformations to accurately represent how light behaves in the physical world.
- This ensures that lighting, shading, and post-processing effects are calculated on correct light intensity values before being displayed on a monitor.
- The following stages outline this pipeline.
    1. **Input Textures (Gamma to Linear):**
        - Textures created by artists are typically saved in the sRGB format (gamma-encoded).
        - For a game engine to perform physically accurate lighting calculations,
            - it must first convert these sRGB textures from **gamma space to linear space**.
        - This ensures that lighting equations for diffuse reflection, specular highlights, and shadows are performed on the actual light intensity values.
    2. **Lighting & Rendering (Linear):**
       - All the heavy lifting of calculating how light bounces around the 3D scene, how shadows are cast, and how materials react to light happens entirely in **linear space**.
       - This is crucial for achieving physically accurate and realistic rendering.
    3. **Post-Processing & Tonemapping (Linear):**
       - Following the initial lighting calculations, many post-processing effects like bloom, depth of field, and color grading are applied in linear space.
       - Tonemapping is a vital step here, which compresses the wide dynamic range of linear light values into a range that can be displayed on a typical monitor.
    4. **Output to Display (Linear to Gamma):**
       - The final rendered image must be converted back from **linear space to gamma space (sRGB)** before it is sent to the display.
       - This final gamma correction step ensures that the monitor receives data it can correctly interpret, presenting a perceptually balanced image to the user.

### Why do images look darker without gamma correction?
- When gamma correction is not applied
    - the display will apply its own gamma curve to the data, expecting it to be in gamma space.
- Since the input value is already linear, the display's gamma curve effectively applies a power function to a value that is already correct.
    - This causes the image to appear significantly darker than intended.
- For example, a linear mid-gray of 0.5 will be treated by the display as a gamma value and will be displayed as $0.5^{2.2} \approx 0.22$, which is perceptually very dark.
