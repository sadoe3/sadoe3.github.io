## Sequential Arrangement
Data Strucutures can be divided into 2 categories based on whether their elements are **arranged sequentially** or not
- if they are
    * then such data structures are called **linear** data structures
    * arrays, linked lists or [**sequential containers**](https://sadoe3.github.io/cpp/primer-chapter9/) in C++ are the typical examples
- if they are not
    * then such data structures are called **non-linear** data structures
    * graphs or [**associative containers**](https://sadoe3.github.io/cpp/primer-chapter11/) in C++ are the typical examples
