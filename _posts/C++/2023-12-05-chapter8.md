# The IO Library

## The IO Types

### IO Library Types and Headers
- There are 3 streams which handles the IO
    * standard(plain) stream
        + it handles the IO regarding a **console window**
        + it's defined in `<iostream>` header
        + `cin` is an `istream` object that reads the input from the standard stream
        + `cout` is an `ostream` object that writes the output to the standard stream
        + `cerr` is an `ostream` object that writes the output, typically error messages, to the standard stream
    * file stream
        + it handles the IO regarding the **named file** 
        + it's defined in `<fstream>` header
    * string stream
        + it handles the IO regarding the **std::string object**
        + it's defined in `<sstream>` header
- the following shows the types defined in those headers<br>

|Header|Type|
|:---:|:---|
|`iostream`|`istream`, `wistream` reads from the standard stream|
|` `|`ostream`, `wostream` writes to the standard stream|
|` `|`iostream`, `wiostream` reads and writes to the standard stream|
|`fstream`|`ifstream`, `wifstream` reads the file stream|
|` `|`ofstream`, `wofstream` writes to the file stream|
|` `|`fstream`, `wfstream` reads and writes to the file stream|
|`sstream`|`istringstream`, `wistringstream` reads the string stream|
|` `|`ostringstream`, `wostringstream` writes to the string stream|
|` `|`stringstream`, `wstringstream` reads and writes to the string stream|
- by default, they manipulate `char` data
    * to support languages that use wide characters, the library defines a set of types and objects that manipulate `wchar_t` data
    * same concepts are applied to both of `char` verion and `wchar_t` version
- we cannot copy or assign objects of the IO types

### IO Operations
The types `ifstream` and `istringstream` **inherit** from `istream`, same thing happens for `ostream` as well
- therefore, we can ignore the differences among these different kinds of streams
- for all streams, we use `>>(input operators)` for input streams, and `<<(output operators)` for input streams

### Condition States
