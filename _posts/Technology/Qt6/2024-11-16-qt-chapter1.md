# Initial Setting

## About Qt
`Qt6` is a very refined **framework** for developing `GUI` applications in `C++`
- it is widely regarded as one of the most powerful and flexible frameworks available for creating **cross-platform** applications with a modern graphical user interface
- you can easily setup Qt by following the steps below


## Install Qt and Visual Studio
It's possible to develop Qt applications using `Qt Creator` which is the standard IDE for Qt
- this blog covers the setup for programmers who want to develop Qt applications using `Visual Studio`
- I assume that `VS` has been already installed in your system, so I skip this

### Install Qt
You can install Qt from the official [Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
- when you install Qt, ensure that you download the version that includes the **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++) toolchain, which is compatible with Visual Studio
- there 2 **licenses** in Qt world
    * commercial license 
        + is closed-source with no obligation
    * open-source
        + is open-source with some obligations
- if you don't have the commercial license, then the installer automatically chooses the open-source license


## Install the Qt Visual Studio Tools
To integrate Qt with Visual Studio, you need to install the `Qt Visual Studio Tools` **extension**, which adds Qt project support to Visual Studio

### Visual Studio Marketplace
You can install this from `Visual Studio Marketplace`
- go to `Extensions` -> `Manage Extensions` in Visual Studio
- search for `Qt Visual Studio Tools` and install it
- after installation, **restart** Visual Studio


## Configure Qt in Visual Studio
Once the extension is installed, you'll need to **configure** the `Qt version` in Visual Studio:
- open Visual Studio
- go to `Tools` -> `Options` -> `Qt` -> `Versions`
- **add** the **path** to your Qt installation under Qt Versions
    * it should point to the `bin` directory inside your Qt installation
    * e.g. `C:\Qt\6.6.3\msvc2019_64`
    * ensure the **right version** of Qt (e.g., Qt6) is selected, and select the appropriate `MSVC` compiler version (matching your Visual Studio installation)


## Create a Qt Project
You can now create a new **Qt project** in Visual Studio:
- go to `File` -> `New` -> `Project`
- in the project creation wizard, search for `Qt` templates, select
    * the `Qt Widgets` Application or
    * the `Qt Quick` Application
- then, select your desired template, configure the project settings, and finish the setup

### Qt Widget
**Qt Widgets** is the traditional framework for developing GUI applications in Qt
- it's based on C++ and provides a set of `widget-based` UI elements (`buttons`, `labels`, etc.) that are drawn using the platform's **native toolkit**
- these the `advantages` of using **Qt Widgets**
    * **Mature** and **Stable**:
        + Qt Widgets has been around for a long time, so it's well-established and stable
        + it's been used in production systems for years, including in desktop applications
        + the framework is robust, and its APIs are well-documented with plenty of resources available
    * **Full Control** Over Layouts:
        + Qt Widgets provides fine-grained control over the layout and behavior of UI components, giving developers the **flexibility** to fine-tune the `UI`
        + you can use complex and custom layouts, and it's easier to integrate complex, native components
    * Better for **Desktop** Applications:
        + if you're building a traditional desktop application with **classic** window-based controls, Qt Widgets is generally more natural because it was designed for this purpose
        + supports a wide range of built-in widgets, including buttons, sliders, checkboxes, and more complex items like tables and trees
    * Well-Suited for **C++-centric** Development:
        + developers who are deeply **familiar with C++** will feel right at **home** with Qt Widgets because the UI is defined and controlled entirely through C++ code
        + if you need to access low-level system features or write performance-critical code, the direct control over widgets and their events is beneficial
    * **Performance**:
        + because Qt Widgets rely on traditional OS-level rendering (native controls), they can be more efficient in scenarios where you're dealing with desktop-specific applications
        + they tend to be more resource-friendly for typical desktop use cases
- and these are the `disadvantages` of using **Qt Widgets**
    * Less Modern Look and Feel:
        + Qt Widgets' default appearance can look somewhat dated, especially when compared to modern mobile or web applications
        + although you can customize it, achieving a polished, modern look can be more challenging
        + styling (like animations, shadows, and transitions) is more difficult to implement than in Qt Quick
    * Limited Support for Responsive Layouts:
        + Qt Widgets is designed with traditional desktop applications in mind, and it lacks native support for responsive UIs (UIs that adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions, as needed for mobile apps)
        + although you can implement custom layout management, it can get cumbersome and less flexible than Qt Quick when working on multiple form factors (desktop, tablet, phone)
    * More Boilerplate Code:
        + With Qt Widgets, you generally write more boilerplate C++ code for setting up UI components, managing layouts, and connecting events (signals and slots)
        + the separation of logic and UI is less intuitive than in Qt Quick, leading to a longer development cycle for UI-heavy applications
    * Not Ideal for Mobile or Touch UIs:
        + Qt Widgets is not inherently designed for building mobile applications. While it can be done, it's not as efficient or flexible for touch-based UIs compared to Qt Quick
        + the mobile-specific components (like swipe gestures or touch-friendly buttons) are more cumbersome to implement

### Qt Quick
**Qt Quick** is a more modern framework built to support fluid, dynamic UIs
- it allows developers to define user interfaces declaratively and is better suited for mobile, embedded, and touch-based applications
- these the `advantages` of using **Qt Quick**
    * Declarative UI with **QML**:
        + QML (Qt Modeling Language) allows developers to define the user interface in a declarative way, meaning you describe what the interface should do and look like, rather than writing imperative code to manage every little detail
        + this leads to much simpler, cleaner, and more concise code, especially for UI-heavy applications
    * **Modern** Look and Feel:
        + Qt Quick supports highly interactive, dynamic, and animated UIs that are easy to implement
        + with smooth animations and transitions, it is much better suited for modern interfaces
        + it's designed for fluid, scalable UIs that look good across a range of devices, including mobile and touchscreen interfaces
        + CSS-like styling allows easy customization of components, creating a more modern, polished look
    * **Highly Responsive** and Scalable:
        + Qt Quick and QML make it much easier to develop responsive user interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes (like for mobile apps, tablets, or large displays)
        + QML provides automatic scaling and makes it straightforward to create multi-platform applications (like for mobile, embedded, and desktop)
    * Integration with **C++**:
        + although Qt Quick uses QML for UI, the backend logic can be written in C++, and both are tightly integrated
        + you can extend QML with C++ to handle performance-critical operations and access system-level functionality, making it a hybrid solution that allows for both flexibility and power
    * **Faster Prototyping**:
        + Qt Quick allows for rapid UI prototyping because the UI is defined in QML (which is more concise and less verbose than C++) and can be adjusted quickly
        + the real-time feedback from changes in the QML files makes iterating on the UI very fast
- these the `disadvantages` of using **Qt Quick**
    * Performance Concerns (for Complex UIs):
        + although Qt Quick is designed to be efficient, complex UIs with a large number of components and animations can suffer from performance issues, especially on less powerful devices
        + QML is interpreted at runtime, which can sometimes result in lower performance than native C++-based solutions, particularly for highly complex applications
    * Learning Curve (QML & JavaScript):
        + while QML is easy to pick up for anyone with experience in declarative UI frameworks (like HTML/CSS/JS), it still introduces a learning curve for developers who are used to imperative C++ programming
        + JavaScript is often used alongside QML for logic, and developers familiar with C++ might find it a bit of a shift
    * Less Control Over Rendering:
        + Qt Quick abstracts a lot of the low-level details of widget rendering
        + while this is great for ease of use, it means you have less control over how individual components are drawn and managed compared to Qt Widgets, which can be a disadvantage for fine-tuned UIs or performance optimizations
    * Not Always the Best for Classic Desktop Applications:  
        + Qt Quick is ideal for mobile, touch, or highly interactive UIs, but it might feel a little over-engineered for traditional desktop applications that don't require fluid animations or complex visual effects
        + although it's possible to build traditional desktop apps with Qt Quick, Qt Widgets might be a more natural choice for these kinds of applications
    * Integration Complexity with Legacy Code:
        + if you're working with an existing application built in Qt Widgets, integrating Qt Quick can sometimes be tricky, especially if you need to combine QML with C++-based logic
        + mixing the two paradigms (QML for UI, C++ for logic) can sometimes lead to more complexity and may not always be as smooth as working entirely in one framework


## Building and Running
You can now **build** and **run** your Qt application **directly** from `Visual Studio` as you would with any other C++ project
- the `Qt Visual Studio Tools extension` will take care of integrating the build system and make sure the correct Qt libraries are linked during compilation
