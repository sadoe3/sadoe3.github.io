# Initial Setting

## About Qt
`Qt6` is a very refined **framework** for developing `GUI` applications in `C++`
- it is widely regarded as one of the most powerful and flexible frameworks available for creating **cross-platform** applications with a modern graphical user interface
- you can easily setup Qt by following the steps below


## Install Qt and Visual Studio
It's possible to develop Qt applications using `Qt Creator` which is the standard IDE for Qt
- this blog covers the setup for programmers who want to develop Qt applications using `Visual Studio`
- I assume that `VS` has been already installed in your system, so I skip this

### Install Qt
You can install Qt from the official [Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
- when you install Qt, ensure that you download the version that includes the **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++) toolchain, which is compatible with Visual Studio
- there 2 **licenses** in Qt world
    * commercial license 
        + is closed-source with no obligation
    * open-source
        + is open-source with some obligations
- if you don't have the commercial license, then the installer automatically chooses the open-source license


## Install the Qt Visual Studio Tools
To integrate Qt with Visual Studio, you need to install the `Qt Visual Studio Tools` **extension**, which adds Qt project support to Visual Studio

### Visual Studio Marketplace
You can install this from `Visual Studio Marketplace`
- go to `Extensions` -> `Manage Extensions` in Visual Studio
- search for `Qt Visual Studio Tools` and install it
- after installation, **restart** Visual Studio


## Configure Qt in Visual Studio
Once the extension is installed, you'll need to **configure** the `Qt version` in Visual Studio:
- open Visual Studio
- go to `Tools` -> `Options` -> `Qt` -> `Versions`
- **add** the **path** to your Qt installation under Qt Versions
    * it should point to the `bin` directory inside your Qt installation
    * e.g. `C:\Qt\6.6.3\msvc2019_64`
    * ensure the **right version** of Qt (e.g., Qt6) is selected, and select the appropriate `MSVC` compiler version (matching your Visual Studio installation)


## Create a Qt Project
You can now create a new **Qt project** in Visual Studio:
- go to `File` -> `New` -> `Project`
- in the project creation wizard, search for `Qt` templates, select
    * the `Qt Widgets` Application or
    * the `Qt Quick` Application
- then, select your desired template, configure the project settings, and finish the setup

### Qt Widget
C++ based API -> do not depend on anything else -> can development widget-based application in Qt creator
For desktop -> native style supported -> other platforms -> not supported
If you want just desktop application, then using Qt widget only may be the answer -> however, for cross-platform or more professional-looking UI developing with Qt Quick would be better solution

### Qt Quick
Qt Quick is typically used for writing QML, which is based on JavaScript - although C++ or Python will still be needed to help with the connection to the backend. You can connect QML and C++.
Can build Qt Quick Uis with a separate tool, Qt Design Studio -> and can import the designs to Qt Creator


## Building and Running
You can now build and run your Qt application directly from Visual Studio as you would with any other C++ project
- the `Qt Visual Studio Tools extension` will take care of integrating the build system and make sure the correct Qt libraries are linked during compilation.
