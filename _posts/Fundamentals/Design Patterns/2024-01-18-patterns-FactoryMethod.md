# Creational Pattern

> 이 포스트는 Design Patterns (1st Edition)를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.

## Pattern Name
Factory Method

### Also Known As
Virtual Constructor


## Problem

### Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let **subclasses decide which class to instantiate**. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Applicability
Use the Factory Method pattern when
• a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
• a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
• classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.


## Solution

### Motivation
Suppose that ~
The problem is that ~

A solution is to ~

### Participants
