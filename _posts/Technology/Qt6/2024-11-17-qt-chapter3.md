# Design
This post covers things related to **design** of `Qt Wdiget` Applications

## Qt Designer
Unlike **Qt Quick** applications where `QML` or `Qt Design Studio` is utilized for designing, `Qt Widgets` applications use `C++` and `Qt Designer`
- `Qt Designer` gives you **WYSIWYG** manner in terms of designing the software
    * moreover, all **property** sets in `Qt Designer` can be **changed dynamically** within the `C++` code
- `Qt Designer` is opened automatically if you double click the `ui` file
    * it's possible to open `ui` file with a text editor for sure
- you can select the widget from the list which is called **object inspector**, and change its property
    * the properties are in order of the class hierarchy
- with `Qt Designer`, you can easily add the widget by using **drag and drop**

### Layout
**Layout managers** are responsible for managing the **arrangement** and **resizing** of its child widget
- they need to be the **top-level** widget (or the direct child of the top-level widget) to ensure proper layout management
    * which means that all widgets to paint are recommended to have a layout manager as their parent for automatic resizing, alignment, and a flexible UI design that adapts to window resizing and dynamic content changes
    * otherwise, you would have to manually manage widget sizes and positions, leading to **less flexibility** and more **complex code**
- in `Qt Designer`, you can setup the layout in 2 ways
    * create layout manager first
        + then drag and drop other widgets to that manager
    * create widgets first
        + then select them -> click the proper buttons which are located at the top middle to align them vertically or horizontally
- you can easily **break** the layout by clicking the break layout button
- if you need extra spaces adding **spacers** is recommended
- once you finish setting up the layout
    * pressing size adjust button (`ctrl + j`) is good for setting up the **proper size** of the window
- it's possible to design in `C++` code only
    ```c++
    SimpleWindow::SimpleWindow(QWidget* parent) : QWidget(parent) {
        auto labelNote = new QLabel("Note:", this);
        auto editNote = new QTextEdit(this);
        auto buttonClear = new QPushButton("Clear", this);
        auto buttonSave = new QPushButton("Save", this);

        auto outer = new QVBoxLayout;
        outer->addWidget(labelNote);
        outer->addWidget(editNote);

        auto inner = new QHBoxLayout;
        inner->addWidget(buttonClear);
        inner->addWidget(buttonSave);
        outer->addLayout(inner);

        this->setLayout(outer);
    }
    ```
    * it's worth noting that when you create a widget, you need to set the **parent** for that object so that **parent-child** relationship is created which is necessary for Qt's basic mechanism
    * you can add a **layout** to a **layout** so that a single layout manager contains multiple layouts
    * in order to apply this layout, you need to call `setLayout()` from the widget that you want to paint on with the **top-level** layout manager


## Extra Details

### Buddies and Tab Order
You can set the `focus transfer` feature and `tab order` by changing the **mode** in `Qt Designer`
- **buddies** gives you the `focus transfer` feature
    * you can setup the connection by using **drag and drop**
- `tab order` is set by **clicking** the widget in the order you want

### Button Group
It's possible to manage multiple radio buttons inside a single container called **button group**
- click the radio buttons -> right click -> assign to button group -> new button group
    * click them again -> assign them to that button group
- if you want to create new button group
    * you have to click other buttons -> right click
    * then it will give you the new button group menu

### Menu
You can easily setup the **menus** by clicking the menu button and typing what you want
- if you put `&` before the **first character** of the menu
    * you can **open** the menu by pressing `alt + the first character`

### QComboBox
It's possible to add multiple items to `QComboxBox` at once by using this code
```c++
myCmb->addItems({ "one", "two", "three", "four" });
```

### LineEdit with Thousands Separator
```c++
void MainWindow::on_lineEditValue_textChanged(const QString &arg1) {
    QLocale converter;
    QString tempString = arg1;
    tempString.remove(",");

    ui->lineEditValue->setText(converter.toString(tempString.toULong()));
}
```
