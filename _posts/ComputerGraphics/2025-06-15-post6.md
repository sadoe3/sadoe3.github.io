# Camera
- This report outlines the fundamental principles of camera operation, both in the physical world and within the context of computer graphics.
- It covers concepts ranging from light convergence and focusing to the implementation of visual effects like defocus blur and anti-aliasing.

## **Constructing the Camera's Basis Axes**
- In 3D graphics, a camera's local coordinate system is defined by three orthogonal basis vectors.
- These vectors are constructed to align with the camera's orientation in the world, allowing for the correct projection of 3D objects onto a 2D viewport.
- The process relies on three key parameters:
    - the camera's position (**lookfrom**)
    - the point it is aimed at (**lookat**)
    - a world-space **up vector**

### **Defining the Camera's Local Axes**
- The camera's local axes (typically referred to as the **u-v-w** basis or **right-up-view** basis) can be calculated using vector operations:
    1. **View Direction (w-axis)**
        - The first axis is the camera's view direction.
            - This is a vector pointing from the `lookfrom` position to the `lookat` point.
        - To form a proper basis vector, it must be normalized.
            - $w=\text{unit\_vector}(\text{lookfrom}−\text{lookat})$
        - The vector is defined as `lookfrom - lookat` to ensure the w-axis points **away** from the scene, which is the standard convention for left-handed coordinate systems often used in computer graphics.
    2. **Right Vector (u-axis)**
        - The second axis, or "right" vector, is perpendicular to both the view direction and the world-space up vector.
            - It is computed using a **cross product**.
        - The world-space up vector is typically $(0,1,0)$, but it's important to use a normalized version of it in the calculation.
            - $u=\text{unit\_vector}(\text{up\_vector}\times w)$
    3. **Corrected Up Vector (v-axis)**
        - The third axis is the "up" vector in the camera's local space.
            - It must be perfectly orthogonal to both the view direction and the right vector.
        - While an initial up vector is provided, a new, corrected up vector is generated to ensure this orthogonality.
            - This is also calculated using a cross product.
            - $v=w\times u$
        - The order of the vectors in the cross product is crucial for a right-handed or left-handed coordinate system.
            - The order shown above is consistent with the left-handed system used in the initial derivation of $u$.
