# Colors
- This report explains the fundamental concepts of how digital colors are handled in computer graphics, focusing on the sRGB color space and gamma correction.

## sRGB

### Color Channel
- When a single color channel (e.g., Red, Green, or Blue) has 8 bits, it can represent 256 distinct levels of intensity for that particular color component. This allows for a total of $256^3$ or over 16.7 million unique colors when combined in an RGB system.

### What is sRGB?
- sRGB (standard Red Green Blue) is the most common and widely adopted color space standard for consumer-level digital content, including the Internet, digital cameras, and computer monitors. 
- It defines how colors should appear on displays and serves as a crucial reference for color consistency.
- The sRGB specification defines two key components:
    1. **Primary Chromaticities:** The precise spectral compositions for its red, green, and blue primary colors, as well as its white point (D65 illuminant).
    2. **Transfer Function (Gamma Curve):** A specific non-linear opto-electronic transfer function that relates linear light intensity to digital color values. This function, often approximated by a gamma of 2.2, is a piecewise function with a linear segment near black and a power function for the rest.

### How does the sRGB format aid in file compression?
- The sRGB format aids in texture compression by encoding color information in a non-linear way that more closely matches human perception. 
- Our visual system is more sensitive to changes in darker tones. 
    - By allocating more bits to represent these darker shades, sRGB ensures that the limited 8-bit color space is utilized more efficiently from a perceptual standpoint, reducing visible banding and improving compression quality.

### Is RGB(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) mid-gray??
- In a **linear** color space, RGB(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) mathematically represents a mid-gray. 
- However, in a **gamma-encoded** color space, this value appears much brighter than a true perceptual mid-gray. 
    - The true mid-gray in a gamma space is significantly darker because of the non-linear curve.

### 18% gray
- 18% gray is a specific shade of neutral gray that reflects 18% of the light that falls on it. 
- It is a key reference point in photography and cinematography for exposure metering. 
- A common misconception is that 18% gray corresponds to a digital value of 0.18 (out of 1.0) in an sRGB space. However, due to the non-linear sRGB transfer function, an 18% linear gray value corresponds to a digital value of approximately 0.457 ($0.18^{1/2.2}$), which is what appears as a perceptually mid-gray on a monitor. 


## Gamma Correction

### What is Gamma Correction?
**The Core Idea:** The human visual system and digital displays do not perceive brightness in a linear fashion. Instead, human eyes are more sensitive to subtle changes in **dark tones** than in bright ones. This non-linear perception is an evolutionary trait, and the resulting non-linear color space is referred to as **gamma space**. In contrast, physical light in the real world and the calculations performed by computers operate in a **linear space**.

**The Solution: Transfer Function (Gamma Correction):**

A transfer function, specifically gamma encoding, is applied to linear light values to bridge this gap. This non-linear operation "brightens up" the dark tones and compresses the bright tones to make them more perceptually uniform for our eyes. The reverse process, gamma decoding, is crucial for rendering calculations, as all physical light interactions (e.g., combining colors, shadows) must occur in **linear space** to be physically accurate. Failure to properly manage this transfer function can lead to an image that is significantly darker or has an incorrect tonal balance.

### How to apply gamma correction?
- A common simplification uses a gamma value of 2 to illustrate the conversion between linear and gamma spaces.
    * To convert a gamma-encoded value $g$ to a linear value $l$:
        $l = g^\gamma$
        For a gamma of 2, this becomes: $l = g^2$.
    * To convert a linear value $l$ back to a gamma-encoded value $g$:
        $g = l^{1/\gamma}$
        For a gamma of 2, this becomes: $g = \sqrt{l}$.

### Should normal and roughness textures be gamma-corrected?
- No, normal and roughness textures should not be gamma-corrected. These textures store data that represents physical properties of a surface (e.g., direction of a normal, surface roughness), not color. This data must remain linear for physically based rendering calculations to be correct.

### Color Space in 3D Game Engines
- A 3D game engine can be conceptualized as a virtual physics simulator for light. The color pipeline can be broken down into four key stages:
    1. **Input Textures (Gamma to Linear):** Textures created by artists are typically saved in the sRGB format (gamma-encoded). For a game engine to perform physically accurate lighting calculations, it must first convert these sRGB textures from **gamma space to linear space**. This ensures that lighting equations for diffuse reflection, specular highlights, and shadows are performed on the actual light intensity values.
    2. **Lighting & Rendering (Linear):** All the heavy lifting of calculating how light bounces around the 3D scene, how shadows are cast, and how materials react to light happens entirely in **linear space**. This is crucial for achieving physically accurate and realistic rendering.
    3. **Post-Processing & Tonemapping (Linear):** Following the initial lighting calculations, many post-processing effects like bloom, depth of field, and color grading are applied in linear space. Tonemapping is a vital step here, which compresses the wide dynamic range of linear light values into a range that can be displayed on a typical monitor.
    4. **Output to Display (Linear to Gamma):** The final rendered image must be converted back from **linear space to gamma space (sRGB)** before it is sent to the display. This final gamma correction step ensures that the monitor receives data it can correctly interpret, presenting a perceptually balanced image to the user.

### Why do images look darker without gamma correction?
- When gamma correction is not applied—meaning a linear-space image is sent directly to a display—the display will apply its own gamma curve to the data, expecting it to be in gamma space. Since the input value is already linear, the display's gamma curve effectively applies a power function to a value that is already correct, causing the image to appear significantly darker than intended. For example, a linear mid-gray of 0.5 will be treated by the display as a gamma value and will be displayed as $0.5^{2.2} \approx 0.22$, which is perceptually very dark.
