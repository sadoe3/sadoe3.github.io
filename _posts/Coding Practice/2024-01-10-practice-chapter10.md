Class -> single responsibitliy -> resp. = reason to change -> if it's multiple -> decompse -> multiple class -> multiple classes can be used together through composition or inheritance -> class would be small -> a system with many small classes is better than a system with a few large classes

data member (instance variable in java) -> small number -> cohesion = how many data members are used by the each methods -> maximally cohesive = a class in which each variable is used by each method -> maximally cohesive is not advisable and impossible ->  high cohesion is recommended -> why? -> 



for change?
