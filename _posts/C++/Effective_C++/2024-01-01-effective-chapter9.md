## Item 53

### Pay attention to compiler warnings
Take **compiler warnings** seriously, and strive to compile warning-free at the maximum warning level supported by your compilers
- however, don't become dependent on compiler warnings
    * because different compilers warn about different things
    * posting to a new compiler may eliminate warning messages you've come to rely on


## Item 55

### Familiarize yourself with Boost
**Boost** is a community and web site for the development of free, open source, peer-reviewed C++ libraries
- Boost plays an influential role in C++ standardization
- Boost offers implementations of may TR1 components, but it also offers many other libraries, as well
