# Associative Containers

> 이 포스트는 C++ Primer(5th Edition)를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.

## Using an Associative Container

### Core Concept of Associative Containers
Associative Containers store the element based on the concept of **key-value** relationships
- sequential containers store the element based on the concept of **sequntial position**
- although the associative containers share much of the behavior of the sequential containers, they differ from the sequential containers in ways that reflect the use of keys

### Types of Associative Containers
