# Algorithms

> 이 포스트는 C로 배우는 쉬운 자료구조를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.

## Core Concept
An algorithm is a **procedure** which is utilized in order to **solve a problem** or **achieve an objective**


## Performance
There are various ways to **compare algorithms**
- among them, **time complexity** and **space complexity** are good measurements to compare algorithms
    * both of them use **big O notation**
	    + Which gives the resulting time based on the number of elements
	    + such as, `O(n)`, `O(logn)`

### Time Complexity
Time complexity is the **amount of time** which is taken for **completing the algorithm**
- it usually handles the **worst case**
    * which gives the **maximum time**

### Space Complexity
Space complexity is the **amount of memory** used by the algorithm


## Sort and Search
In this blog, algorithms regarding **sort** and **search** would be covered

### Sort
The core concept of sort algorithms is to **reorganize** the collection of elements based on the element’s certain value
- that value is called as a **key**
- you can also set the order of reorganization among 2 ways
    * ascending Order
	    + from the smallest to the largest
	* descending Order
	    + From the largest to the smallest

### Search
The core concept of search algorithms is to **find** the element which has the certain value (**key**)
