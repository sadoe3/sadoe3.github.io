### Core Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++ (Modern C++17 Standards)
- **Graphics/System:** DirectX 12, Win32 API
- **Key Algorithms:** Sweep and Prune (SAP), GJK, EPA, Sequential Impulse Solver, Continuous Collision Detection (CCD).


## 2. Architecture & Pipeline
- The simulation executes a multi-stage pipeline designed to balance performance and accuracy:

### 1. Integration
- Updates linear and angular velocities along with positions based on accumulated forces, including gravity, external impulses, and user intervention.

### 2. Broad Phase
- Rapidly culls non-colliding pairs using axis-sorting algorithms (Sweep and Prune) to minimize the computational workload for subsequent stages.

### 3. Narrow Phase
- Precisely determines collision manifolds, including contact points and normals, utilizing Convex Hull algorithms (GJK/EPA) for accurate intersection testing.

### 4. Resolution
- Solves mechanical constraints and contact penetrations using a sequential impulse-based solver to ensure physical stability.


## 3. Collision Detection

### 3.1. Broad Phase: Optimized Sweep and Prune (SAP)
- To efficiently manage scenes with high object counts, the engine utilizes the **Sweep and Prune (SAP)** algorithm. 
- A significant optimization implemented here is **Dynamic Axis Selection**. 
    - Instead of adhering to a fixed axis, the system evaluates the spatial variance of objects each frame and sorts them along the axis with the largest extent. 
    - This minimizes the number of overlapping intervals on the projection axis, significantly reducing false positives.
- Implementation Highlight:
    - The implementation ensures memory safety and avoids $O(N^2)$ checks by maintaining an active list of overlapping bodies.

    ```cpp
    void SweepAndPrune1D(const Body* bodies, const int numBodies, std::vector<collisionPair_t>& finalPairs, const float deltaSecond) {
        // Optimization: Use std::vector to prevent stack overflow in dense scenes
        std::vector<pseudoBody_t> sortedBodies(numBodies * 2);

        // 1. Calculate Bounds & Select Optimal Axis
        SortBodiesBounds(bodies, numBodies, sortedBodies.data(), deltaSecond);

        // 2. Build Collision Pairs using Active List approach (O(N + K))
        BuildPairs(finalPairs, sortedBodies.data(), numBodies);
    }

    void BuildPairs(std::vector<collisionPair_t>& collisionPairs, const pseudoBody_t* sortedBodies, const int numBodies) {
        // Note: finalPairs is cleared in the caller (BroadPhase)
        std::vector<int> activeList; // Stores IDs of currently overlapping bodies

        const int doubleNumBodies = numBodies * 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < doubleNumBodies; ++i) {
            const pseudoBody_t& targetBody = sortedBodies[i];
            int bodyId = targetBody.id;

            if (targetBody.isMin) {
                // Body enters the sweep axis: Pair with all currently active bodies
                for (int activeId : activeList) {
                    collisionPair_t pair;
                    pair.a = std::min(bodyId, activeId);
                    pair.b = std::max(bodyId, activeId);
                    collisionPairs.push_back(pair);
                }
                activeList.push_back(bodyId);
            } else {
                // Body exits the sweep axis: Remove from active list
                auto it = std::remove_if(activeList.begin(), activeList.end(),
                    [bodyId](int id) { return id == bodyId; });
                activeList.erase(it, activeList.end());
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### 3.2. Narrow Phase: GJK & EPA
- For precise collision detection between convex polyhedra, the engine employs the **Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK)** algorithm.
- **Intersection Test:** 
    - GJK iteratively constructs a simplex inside the Configuration Space Object (CSO) to determine if it encloses the origin.
- **Contact Generation:**
    - Upon collision, the **Expanding Polytope Algorithm (EPA)** is triggered to calculate the penetration depth and contact normal by expanding the simplex to the CSO boundary.
- For performance-critical primitives like **spheres**, specialized algebraic tests (Ray-Sphere, Sphere-Sphere) are implemented to **bypass expensive GJK iterations**.


## 4. Hybrid Collision Resolution
- The engine intelligently dispatches detected contacts to different solvers based on the collision context.

### 4.1. Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)
- To mitigate the "tunneling effect" where high-velocity objects pass through geometry, a **Predictive Impulse Solver** is implemented.
- **Mechanism:** 
    - The system calculates the **Time of Impact (TOI)** for dynamic objects.
- **Execution:** 
    - Contacts are sorted by TOI. 
    - The simulation advances to the earliest impact time ($TOI > 0$), resolves the collision, and repeats. 
    - This guarantees that fast-moving objects interact correctly with static environments.

### 4.2. Sequential Impulse Solver
- For static contacts ($TOI = 0$) and mechanical constraints (joints, resting contact), an **Iterative Constraint Solver** is utilized. 
- This solver applies "Warm Starting"—using the previous frame's solution as an initial guess—to ensure stability in complex stacking scenarios.


## 5. Visual Debugging Suite
- A significant focus of this project was the development of **Runtime Inspection Tools**, acknowledging that rigorous visual validation is critical for physics programming.

### 5.1. Performance Monitor
- A real-time performance graph tracks the current FPS and CPU load. 
- This provides immediate feedback on the efficiency of optimization techniques during stress testing.

### 5.2. Interactive Object Inspector
- Users can pause the simulation and select objects via mouse picking. 
#### **Property Inspector** 
- The inspector panel reveals real-time physical properties, including Linear/Angular Velocity, Mass, and Orientation.

#### **Gizmo Manipulation** 
- Selected objects can be translated or rotated using a 3D gizmo. 
- The physics state is automatically managed (velocity reset) to ensure stability after manipulation.

### 5.3. Deep Contact Visualization
- To verify the accuracy of the Narrow Phase and Solver, the engine offers detailed visualization modes:

#### **Collision Metadata Visualization**
- **Wireframe Rendering Mode:**
    - To mitigate visual occlusion during overlap, the system supports a **wireframe rendering mode** for active entities and their associated collision pairs.
    - This ensures the internal state of the simulation remains visible.

    <img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/debugging/visualization_wireframe.gif" alt="Wireframe rendering applied to selected objects to prevent occlusion" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
- **Manifold & Primitive Identification:**
    - **Contact Data:** Discrete contact points are rendered as **red cubic markers**, while the resulting collision normals are projected as **yellow vectors**, facilitating the empirical verification of the mathematical resolution.
    - **Primitive Highlighting:** For polyhedral shapes, the specific geometric primitive (triangle) identified by the narrow-phase algorithm is highlighted in **blue**, isolating the exact surface contributing to the contact manifold.

    <img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/debugging/visualization_triangle.gif" alt="Visualization of contact manifolds: Red boxes denote contact points, yellow arrows indicate normals, and the blue highlight identifies the collision primitive" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

#### **Hit Result Tree UI**
- When multiple collisions occur, a tree view UI organizes all contact pairs, allowing developers to isolate and inspect specific manifolds.
- Selecting a specific contact point automatically highlights the corresponding subtree within the hierarchy.

<img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/debugging/visualization_result.gif" alt="Hit Result Tree UI highlighting the corresponding subtree upon contact point selection" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

### 5.4. Frame-by-Frame History (Rewind/Replay)
- **Circular State Buffer:**
    - To facilitate the analysis of high-speed collision events, a **Circular History Buffer** was implemented to cache the authoritative simulation state (Transform, Velocity) for the trailing 120 frames.
- **Detached Execution:**
    - **Active Physics Stepping:** 
        - The engine supports active physics simulation starting from any restored historical frame. 
        - This allows developers to test collision resolution logic in a paused environment without affecting the main game loop.
    - **State Restoration:** 
        - Any simulation steps performed during this rewind phase are treated as speculative data. 
        - Upon resuming the live session, the engine discards these changes and reloads the latest cached state, ensuring the continuity of the original gameplay timeline.

## 6. Stress Test & Validation
- A dedicated stress test scene was created to benchmark the engine's performance and stability under various conditions.

<img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/overview/stress_test.gif" alt="Stress Test Scene" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

### 6.1. Test Environment Setup
- The scene offers configurable parameters to test different subsystems:
- **Density (Dense vs. Sparse):** Controls object spacing.
    - *Dense:* Objects are tightly packed to rigorously test SAP overlap checks.

    <img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/stresstest/setup_dense.png" alt="Dense configuration: High object concentration testing broad-phase overlap efficiency" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    - *Sparse:* Objects are spread out to verify culling efficiency.

    <img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/stresstest/setup_sparse.png" alt="Sparse configuration: Widely distributed objects verifying effective spatial culling" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
- **Shape Selection:**
    - *Sphere:* Tests analytic collision algorithms.
    - *Diamond (Convex):* Tests the performance of GJK/EPA algorithms.

    <img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/stresstest/shape_convex.png" alt="Stress testing GJK/EPA algorithms with complex convex polyhedra" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
- **Initial Height:**
    - The initial height can be modified to adjust the potential energy to test high-impact stability and stacking behavior.

    <img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/stresstest/initial_height.gif" alt="Modifying initial drop height to test high-velocity impact stability" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

### 6.2. Optimization Verification
- A runtime toggle for the **Broadphase Optimization** allows for immediate A/B testing between the Sweep and Prune (SAP) algorithm and a brute-force baseline. 
- This setup validates the algorithm's efficiency across different spatial distributions.

#### **Dense Scenario**
- In the **Dense** configuration, objects are tightly clustered, resulting in a high degree of spatial overlap.

<img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/stresstest/dense_not_optimized.gif" alt="Dense Scenario - Brute Force / Unoptimized" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/stresstest/dense_optimized.gif" alt="Dense Scenario - SAP Enabled" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

- **Analysis:** 
    - As observed in the figures above, the performance delta is minimal in the dense scenario. 
    - Due to the high concentration of objects, the number of potential collision pairs remains high regardless of the broadphase strategy. 
    - Consequently, the SAP algorithm cannot effectively cull pairs, shifting the computational load primarily to the Narrowphase.

#### **Sparse Scenario**
- In the **Sparse** configuration, objects are widely distributed across the scene.

<img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/stresstest/sparse_not_optimized.gif" alt="Sparse Scenario - Brute Force / Unoptimized" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/stresstest/sparse_optimized.gif" alt="Sparse Scenario - SAP Enabled" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

- **Analysis:** 
    - The performance gap becomes distinct in this scenario. 
    - The SAP algorithm effectively prunes distant, non-interacting objects, maintaining a stable framerate. 
    - In contrast, the brute-force approach suffers from significant performance degradation due to its complexity, wasting cycles checking collisions between objects that are far apart.


## 7. Sandbox Scene
- The Sandbox scene serves as a comprehensive validation environment, showcasing typical simulation scenarios to verify the stability and versatility of the constraint solver.

#### **Ragdoll**
- This is a complex **Articulated System** test. 
- It verifies hierarchical transformations and the stability of multiple constraints (joints and limits) working in unison.

<img src="/assets/images/physicsengine/sandbox/ragdoll.gif" alt="Articulated ragdoll simulation demonstrating hierarchical joint constraints" style="width: 70%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

## 8. Future Development
