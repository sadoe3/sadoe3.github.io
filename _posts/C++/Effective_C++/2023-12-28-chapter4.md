## Item 18

### Make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly
When you design a class, try to make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly so that you can get **help from the compiler**
```c++
// premature design
class Data {
public:
    Data(int month, int day, int year);
};

// refined design
struct Day {
    explicit Day(int d) : val(d) {}
    int val;
};
struct Month {
    explicit Month(int m) : val(m) {}
    int val;
};
struct Year {
    explicit Year(int y) : val(y) {}
    int val;
};

class Data {
public:
    Data(const Month& month, const Day& day, const Year& year);
};
Date(30, 3, 1995);                    // error; wrong types!
Date(Day(30), Month(3), Year(1992));  // error; wrong types!
Date(Month(3), Day(30), Year(1992));  // ok; types are correct
```
- instead of using only `int`s, using `enum`s might be better
- try to use `const` whenever posssible to avoid unnecessary value change
- ways to facilitate correct use include consistency in interfaces and behavioral compatibility with built-in types
- ways to prevent errors include creating new types, restricting operations on types, constraining object values, and eliminateing client resource management responsibilities


## Item 20

### Prefer pass-by-reference-to-`const` to pass-by-value
If the parameter of the function doesn't need to be changed, 
- try to define it as reference-to-`const`
    * if the type of it is **user-defined**
    * with this approach, you can avoid unnecessary copy operation, possible slicing problem, and prevent the value from being changed
- try to define it as local object
    * if the type of it is **built-in** or **STL iterator** or **STL callable object** types
    * this approach is usually preferred because C++ compiler typically implement references as pointers
        + hence passing a reference is actually passing a pointer
        + which means that if the target type is built-in type
        , then using the actual type can be more efficient
        + same rules are applied to STL iterator or STL callable object types


## Item 21

### Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object
When you return a reference, always make sure that the reference returned refers to the object that exists at that time
```c++
// example of the bad code
const ClassName operator*(const ClassName &lhs, const ClassName &lhs) {
    ClassName result(lhs.a * rhs.a, lhs.b * rhs.b);
    return result;              // result would be destroyed after exiting this function
}
```


## Item 22

### Declare data members `private`
Declaring data members `private` gives clients syntactically uniform access to data, affords fine-grained access control, allows invariants to be enforeced, and offers class authors implmentation flexibility
- `protected` data members are no more encapsulated than `public`
    * because the **encapsulatedness** of a data member is **inversely proportional** to the **amount of code** that might be broken if that data members **changes**


## Item 23

### Prefer non-member non-friend functions to member functions
As the above item explains, the **number of functions** that interact with the `private` data members is **inversely proportional** to the **encapsulatedness**
- the point is that the member function which calls such functions is also **counted** 
    * hence, if you want to define a function which calls such functions, try to define it as non-member and non-friend
- moreover, define different functions in different headers although they are in the same `namespace`
    ```c++
    // header webbrowser.h
    // header for class WebBrowser itself
    // as well as core WebBrowser-related functionality
    namespace WebBrowserStuff {
        class WebBrowser { /* definition */ };
    }

    // header webbrowserbookmarkss.h
    namespace WebBrowserStuff {
        ...                     // bookmark-related convenience functions
    }

    // header webbrowsercookies.h
    namespace WebBrowserStuff {
        ...                     // cookie-related convenience functions
    }
    ```


## Item 24

### Declare non-member functions when type conversions should apply to all parameters
When you define an **overloaded operator**, if there's chance where the **left-hand side object** is constructed through a conversion from another type
- then define it as non-member function
    ```c++
    // problem
    class Rational {
    public:
        Rational(int numerator = 0, int denominator = 1);
        const Rational operator*(const Rational& rhs) const;
        // other members
    };
    Rational oneEighth(1,8);
    Rational oneHalf(1,2);

    Rational result = oneHalf * 2;      // fine
    Rational result = 2 * oneHalf;      // error!
    
    // solution 
    class Rational {
        // same definition without operator*
    };
    const Rational operator*(const Rational& rhs) {
        return Rational(lhs.numerator() * rhs.numerator(), lhs.denominator() * rhs.denominator());
    }
    Rational result = oneHalf * 2;      // fine
    Rational result = 2 * oneHalf;      // fine!
    ```


## Item 25
