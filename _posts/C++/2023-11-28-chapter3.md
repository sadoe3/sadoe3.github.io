# Strings, Vectors, and Arrays

> 이 포스팅은 C++ Primer(5th Edition)를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.

## Namespace using Declaration

### using Declaration
in order to use a name inside a certain namespace, you should type like this : `namespace::name` <br>
but with **using** declaration, you can skip ' namespace:: ' part 
```c++
#include <iostream>

using std::cin;                     // using declaration
using std::endl; using std::string; // multiple using delcarations

int main() {
    int i;

    cin >> i;       // ok
    
    cout << i;      // error
    std::cout << i; // ok

    return 0;
}
```
- :: is the scope operator which let compiler look in the scope of the left-hand operand for the name of the right-hand operand
- when you want to use multiple using declarations in a single line, you need to separate which declaration by semicolon and put using respectively
- headers should not include using declaration
    * because source codes which includes them may not want to use that using declaration

## Library string Type

### STL and sequential container
- in this chapter, string and vector which are sequential container of STL are covered in order to know how to use them in basic way
- STL would be covered deeply in later chapter

### std::string
string is a class which handles the **variable-length** sequence of characters 
```c++
#include <string>
... // some codes

// basic initialiation of std::string
std::string s1;             // default initialization
std::string s2 = s1;        // s2 is the copy of s1
std::string s2(s1);         // same as std::string s2 = s1; 
std::string s3 = "value";   // s3 is the copy of string literal not including null character
std::string s3("value");    // same as std::string s3 = "value"; 
std::string s4(n, 'c');     // s4 is initialized with n copies of character 'c'
```
- in oder to use string class, you need to include \<string> header file
- because string class is defined in std namespace, you need to specify std:: to using string class
    * if you don't want this, try to use using declaration : `using std::string;`
- if string is created by default initialization, it becomes an empty string
- when you intialize an object, there are 2 types based on the existence of =
    * if there is = for initialization, then it would be **copy initialization**
        + through this type of initialization, the object is a copy of the initializer
    * f there is not = for initialization, then it would be **direct initialization**
        + through this type of initialization, the object is initialized by the implemented way of class author


### Operations on strings
||string Operations|
|:---:|:---|
|`os << s`|Writes s onto ouput stream os. Returns os.|
|`is >> s`|Reads whitespace-separated string from is into s. Returns is.|
|`getline(is, s)`|.|
```c++
string s1, s2;

std::cin >> s1 >> s2;       // becuase std::cin>> s1 returns std::cin, we can chain multiple i/o

while(std::cin >> s1)       // read until end-of-file
    std::cout << s1 << std::endl;
```
- i/o operation
    * streams for standard i/o use white space for separator, and once it finds white space, it discards it
    * i/o stream can be used as condition, in this case, it returns true if it handles valid i/o and not end-of-file, and false for opposite case
- getline
