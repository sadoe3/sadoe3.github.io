# Tree

> 이 포스트는 C로 배우는 쉬운 자료구조를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.

## Concept
Trees are typical examples of **non-linear** data structures

### Tree
**Trees** are implemented based on the [**graph**](https://sadoe3.github.io/data-structures/structures-Graph/).
- the difference between the tree and the graph is that
    * tree has a **starting point**
    * therefore, tree contains a hierarchy
- in the perspective of trees, an element is regarded as a **Node**
    * the starting point is referred to as a **root** node
    * a node can be a **parent** node ** which may have **child** node(s)
    * if the node doest **not have any child** node, then it is called a **leaf** (terminal) node
- the **degree** of the node is
    * the number of its **direct child** node(s)
- the **height** of the tree is
    * the maximum **level** of the tree
    * ![LevelsOfTree.pdf](https://github.com/sadoe3/sadoe3.github.io/files/14176233/LevelsOfTree.pdf){: width="50%" height="50%"}
